# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Tkinter**.
It allows users to draw a digit on a canvas and predicts the number using a trained **MNIST deep learning model**.

---

## Technologies

* Python
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Tkinter
* Pillow

---

## Files

* `HandWrittenDigitRecognitionProject.py` – Main program
* `mnist_model.h5` – Trained CNN model

---

## How to Run

1. Install libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```

2. Run the program:

```bash
python HandWrittenDigitRecognitionProject.py
```

---

## How it Works

* Draw a digit using the mouse
* Click **Recognize**
* The model predicts the digit
* Click **Clear** to draw again

---

## Description

The application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset** to recognize handwritten digits in real time.

If you want, I can make it **even shorter (one-page lab style)** 😄
